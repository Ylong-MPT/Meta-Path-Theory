# Meta-Path Theory (MPT)

Foundational framework for Meta-Path Theory (MPT): definitions, axioms, 
mathematical structures, and meta-level principles.

---

## Overview

Meta-Path Theory (MPT) is a structural, scale-covariant and observation-dependent 
framework designed to describe all "divisible, storable, and variable" structures 
in a unified mathematical meta-domain. It introduces:

- **Meta-domain**: the closure of all configuration spaces under path, jet, 
  and functional operations.
- **Meta-paths**: functional trajectories of structures in the meta-domain.
- **Existence value functional** \(E\):  
  \( E[\gamma] \approx \int D(s)\, I(s)\, ds \),  
  where \(D\) is sustained difference and \(I\) is local intensity.
- **Self-consistency principle**: paths maximizing relative E persist 
  under meta-time evolution.
- **Scale covariance and individual–structure duality**:  
  micro-structures and macro-structures are projections of the same 
  meta-path under resolution changes.

This repository contains the formal structure, definitions, axioms, and 
derived mathematical consequences of MPT.
